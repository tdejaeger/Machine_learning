# Machine learning

You can find different examples of machine learning codes using Python.


NEED:  
- Numpy  
- Matplotlib  
- Scipy  
- Sklearn  
- EMCEE
- CORNER  


EXAMPLES:  
- Clustering: +kmeans  
- Linear regressions: Pearson factor, non-linear least squares (curve_fit),  Orthogonal distance regression, Likelihood minimisation (minimize), LinearRegression in Pandas, Bayesian analysis via MCMC (EMEE), data visualisation (Matplotlib, corner)  
- Outlier detection: unsupervised method: Multivariate Gaussian model (3 sigma clipping and EllipticEnvelope), Local Outlier Factor, and the Isolation Forest methods. Supervised methods: Support Vector Machine and Random Forest Classifier
